## 1 Objectives

The main objective of the project consists of designing the management of an
Amazon-like warehouse, where robots are employed to store, move and recover
racks of packages (boxes, in our case).

- The designed Multi-Agent system must be completely autonomous, hence
    there should not be any need for run-time human intervention.
- The implementation has to follow an agent-oriented approach. The delivered knowledge base should work equally well on both your personal test-cases and in our own scenarios; hard-coded solutions are not allowed.
- The C#scripts can be modified at will, provided that the points above are
    respected.
- The project is individual, changing the names of the variables of someone
    elseâ€™s project will not make it an original work!
